we can declare variable by:
1- var x = 10
2- x := 10
3- multiple delarations: var n1,n2,n3 = 1,2,3 or using shourtcut :=

the diffrence is:
in 1 you can chose what type you want for this var exp: var x float64 = 10 ==> flaot64
in 2 you make go chose the type automaticly x := 10.3 ==> float64


constnat variables:
const x = 10
